GIT
  Git is an open source project management softare. It can track cahnges in files, be used to quickly transfeer files betweem PCs/servers/workstations
  We utilized GitHub and Git to edit, transfer, and comment on files.  
  We created README files easily and showed how simple mistakes can heepen
      The oops deliverable is an example of this
      we tried to put the hostname of the PC in the README, but instead of the hostname we added "hostname" 
      
  Git Comaands
    Add 
      tells git we want to include updates to a file in the nesxt commit 
    Clone
      copy a directory off of a GitHub
    Commit
      makes the changes (hitting the save button)
    Push
      sends the working directory and changes to GitHub
      
  Linux vs Windows 
    Linkux will not save Github login information, you will need to input it with each push
    Windows will cache your login info so you only need to input it once
    
SSH
  At this point in the year we all know good ol SSH
  but if you forgot, SSH logins you into secure shells if you know the username, password (if needed), and hostname of a system
  
    Script 
      We created a script that utalizes PKI and creates an SSH user that logins in using RSA keys rather than username and password. The script can also be utalized 
      to diable root's SSH captabilties. It can be found here:
        https://github.com/QuentinD901/SYS265-tech-journal/blob/main/linux/centos7/chungus-secure-ssh.sh
          Creates a user along with a home and ssh directory
          Copies the key from the the SYS folder (gotten off of GitHub) to the user's authorized keys folder
          Sets proper perms for user and his directories/files
          Removes root's ssh capabilities
          
      We generated a Public Key and added it to web01's local repo, this allows us to ssh out of web01 using the Public key if it is a user's authorized keys folder. 
      The script also utalizes Git and Github.
        This is done because we have the it stored on the GutHub repo, making it easily accessible to any of my VMs via Git
