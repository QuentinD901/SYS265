  Cockpit
    GUI for Linux Server Management 
    Can control multiple Linux based devices (as long as they support cockpit)
      Requries the dashboard to monitor multiple hosts
      Can manage package updates, SELinux config, netowrking, and logs
        Also monitors hardware, shows statistics (cpu usage)
    Terminal - allows for a CLI to use the server
      
    Easiest to Add multiple devices if the boxes are in the same AD domain
      This way when adding a box to the dashboard you can use a Domain Admin (which is sudo'd) to login to the machine
