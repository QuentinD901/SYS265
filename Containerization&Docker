Ubuntu
  Networking:
    If you want to "cheat" and use a GUI install "netowrk manager" and use nmtui
   Since we are here to learn edit /etc/netplam/00-installer0config.yaml 
      set dhcp to no
      add address 10.0.5.12/24
      add gateway (gateway4) 10.0.5.2
      add nameservers (DNS) 10.0.5.5
      use "netplan try" to testnew config
      use "netplan apply" to apply the changes 
    
  Hostname:
    hostnamectl set-hostname docker01-quentin
    edit /etc/hosts and replace occurances with new hostname
    reboot 
    or use nmtui to do this much faster
    
  Sudoers:
    to add a sudoer on Ubuntu (NO wheel group on Ubuntu) 
      usermod -aG sudo quentin

Reflection
  Docker is an open source platform for containers. Containers are similar to VM's/Virtulization but not excatly the same. Containers virtulize to run container
  applications. Each container runs an isolated process and containers sharea common OS. Containerization generally uses less resources than VMs, since it does not 
  need to virtulaize a whole OS.
