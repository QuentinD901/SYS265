Key Management 
  Key pairs is what allows for us to decrypt and encrypt the VMs passwords and login information 
  ACCESS CONTROL - keys wont work if they are too accessible   

Security Groups
  This is what allows you to control the firewall settings are what services/ports are open. 
  Our security group currentley consits of RHEL7 and WIN Serv 2019
  
Firewalling
  managed through security groups 
  
Reflection 
  AWS is a simple and easy way to spit up VMs and do tests. Especially becuase AMAZON is hosting it, VM breaks... no problem spit up a new one within minutes. They are
  easy to configure and control. you can control several VMs firewalls with one security group. :)
